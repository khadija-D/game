<h2 id="board">Board Game Exploration</h2>
<p>In this activity, we created our own board game. 
  We were given various supplies such as different game boards, action figures, pipcleaners, dice, and more. We were given complete creative freedom, and had to put our knowledge together to create a cohesive game. 
  Through this we were able to learn what goes into the inner workings of a game such as creating rules, interactions between characters, and more.

<h2 id ="video">Video Game Exploration</h2>
<p>In this activity, we coded our own board game. We started by doing one together with the teacher, and then we did one by ourselves entitled, "Coin Collecter. We were able to customize our own art or use the provided art. Through this we were able to not only improve our coding skils, but problem solvings. For example, if the code wouldn't run right, we had to go through and identify the problem, whether it be a typo or a wrong indentation, and solve it.</p>
