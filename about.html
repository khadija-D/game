        <h1>About the Creator</h1>
        <h2>Information about me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Khadija D. I'm 14 year old and a freshman and highschool. In my free time, I like to read and exercise. 
            I have some experience bacause I've made a couple websites and a physcial stop motion animation before, but I've never made a game before. 
            I don't really play games, so I went out of my comfort zone, so I hope you enjoy.

        <h2>My definition of game</h2>
        <p> 
            In my opinion, a game is a form of playing where you can use your unique skills to win or just have fun. There are different types of gamers. 
            There are 4 main ones, achievers, killers, explorers, and socializers. The achievers like to play to win things and gain the most. The killers like to play to impose their will on other people. 
            They like to watch the world burn. The explorers like to discover new things and explore the worlds. The socializers play to have fun with other people. My two main types are achiever and killer.
            To be honest, I don't play many games. So, hopefully  fo people like me who don't have much interest in games, this will change that in them.
